# development of your dashboard.

# In order to help prevent unpublished data being accidentally published, the
# template will not let you make a commit if there are unidentified csv, xlsx,
# tex or pdf files contained in your repository. To make a commit, you will need
# to either add the file to .gitignore or add an entry for the file into
# datafiles_log.csv.
